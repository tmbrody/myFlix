    <p>
      This API will be used as the server-side 
      component for a movie-focused web application called myFlix. 
      Through this API, the web application will allow users to access
      details about many different movies, directors and genres. 
      Users will have the option to create accounts on the site 
      that will let them create and save lists of their favorite movies. 
      This web app will function through a well-designed REST API and 
      architected database built with JavaScript, Node.js, Express and 
      MongoDB. The REST API will be accessed via commonly-used HTTP methods 
      like GET and POST, and the common CRUD methods will also be used 
      for data retrieval from the database and non-relational data storage.

It is usually distinguished from mainstream fiction and other genres such as historical fiction or science fiction, but the boundaries are indistinct. Crime fiction has multiple subgenres, including detective fiction (such as the whodunit), courtroom drama, hard-boiled fiction, and legal thrillers. Most crime drama focuses on crime investigation and does not feature the courtroom. Suspense and mystery are key elements that are nearly ubiquitous to the genre."

        "Description": "In film and television, drama is a category or genre of narrative fiction (or semi-fiction) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone. Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular super-genre, macro-genre, or micro-genre, such as soap opera, police crime drama, political drama, legal drama, historical drama, domestic drama, teen drama, and comedy-drama (dramedy). These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter, or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods. To these ends, a primary element in a drama is the occurrence of conflict—emotional, social, or otherwise—and its resolution in the course of the storyline."

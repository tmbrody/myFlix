    <p>
      This API will be used as the server-side 
      component for a movie-focused web application called myFlix. 
      Through this API, the web application will allow users to access
      details about many different movies, directors and genres. 
      Users will have the option to create accounts on the site 
      that will let them create and save lists of their favorite movies. 
      This web app will function through a well-designed REST API and 
      architected database built with JavaScript, Node.js, Express and 
      MongoDB. The REST API will be accessed via commonly-used HTTP methods 
      like GET and POST, and the common CRUD methods will also be used 
      for data retrieval from the database and non-relational data storage.

Crime fiction has multiple subgenres,[2] including detective fiction (such as the whodunit), courtroom drama, hard-boiled fiction, and legal thrillers. Most crime drama focuses on crime investigation and does not feature the courtroom. Suspense and mystery are key elements that are nearly ubiquitous to the genre."

        "Name": "Comedy",
        "Description": "Comedy is a genre of fiction that consists of discourses or works intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, film, stand-up comedy, television, radio, books, or any other entertainment medium. The term originated in ancient Greece: in Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by political satire performed by comic poets in theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance pitting two groups, ages, genders, or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a 'Society of Youth' and a 'Society of the Old'. A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions posing obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth then becomes constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to resort to ruses which engender dramatic irony, which provokes laughter."

    "Genre": {
        "Name": "Drama",
        "Description": "In film and television, drama is a category or genre of narrative fiction (or semi-fiction) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone.[1] Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular super-genre, macro-genre, or micro-genre,[2] such as soap opera, police crime drama, political drama, legal drama, historical drama, domestic drama, teen drama, and comedy-drama (dramedy). These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter, or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods. To these ends, a primary element in a drama is the occurrence of conflict—emotional, social, or otherwise—and its resolution in the course of the storyline."

He has an extraordinary number of commercially successful and critically acclaimed credits to his name, either as a director, producer or writer since launching the summer blockbuster with Jaws (1975), and he has done more to define popular film-making since the mid-1970s than anyone else.",
